_netlifyDeploy {two-colons} AttrSet -> Effect_

Deploys content to https://www.netlify.com[Netlify], the CDN and web platform that coined _JamStack_.

Example:

```nix
effects.netlifyDeploy {
  siteId = "...";
  secretName = "default-netlify";
  productionDeployment = true;
  content = runCommand "site" {} ''
    mkdir $out
    echo "<h1>Hi!</h1>" >$out/index.html
  '';
}
```

Example secret:

```json
  "netlify-test-account": {
    "kind": "Secret",
    "data": {
      "token": "..."
    },
    "condition": {
      "and": [
        { "isOwner": "my-github-org" },
        { "isRepo": "my-site-repo" }
      ]
    }
  }
```

[[parameters]]
== `Parameters`

[[param-name]]
=== `siteId`

An opaque identifier assigned by Netlify.

You can retrieve this value by logging in to Netlify, creating or navigating to the site you want to deploy, click btn:[Site settings], then copy the value after _Site ID:_ from the _Site information_ box.

==== Disable Netlify's integrated builds

While you're in the _Site settings_, you'll want to make sure Netlify's deployments don't interfere.

Go to btn:[Build & deploy] in the _Site settings_ menu, then click btn:[Edit settings] in the _Build settings_ box. Select btn:[Stop builds] and btn:[Save].

See https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/stop-or-activate-builds/#stop-builds[Stop or activate builds] for more details.

[[param-secretName]]
=== `secretName`

The secret that will be looked up in xref:hercules-ci-agent:ROOT:secrets-json.adoc[`secrets.json`].

The `data` field must contain a `"token"` field, with a string value that is a Netlify personal access token. To make one, navigate to https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens[Personal access tokens] and use btn:[New access token].

[[param-content]]
=== `content`

Path to the site content, also known as the _Publish directory_.

This includes files such as `netlify.toml`, `_redirects`, and all web resources, like `index.html`, style sheets, etc.

You'll typically put a derivation here.

[[param-productionDeployment]]
=== `productionDeployment`

Whether this is a production deployment. Default: `false`.

You can use the `herculesCI` attribute xref:hercules-ci-agent:ROOT:evaluation.adoc#params-herculesCI-commit[parameters] to make this conditional on the branch name.

In a flake:

```nix
effects = { branch, ... }: {
  netlify = netlifyDeploy {
    # ...
    productionDeployment = branch == "main";
  };
};
```

In a `ci.nix`, `default.nix` or flake:

```nix
herculesCI = { branch }: {
  onPush.default =
  # let netlifyDeploy = ...; in
  {
    outputs = {
      effects.netlify = netlifyDeploy {
        # ...
        productionDeployment = branch == "main";
      };
    };
  };
};
```
